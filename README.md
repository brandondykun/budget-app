# Description

Budget App was built as a way to monitor savings in a simple, easy to use platform. It allows users to add pay and savings, list planned future expenses based on wants vs. needs, and create a reminders list.

It was created on personal request from a friend who needed a centralized location to list and view income and savings to better understand the percentage of income that was being saved.

# Technologies

Frontend built with React, and the backend uses Firebase. The included .env.template file includes the necessary Firebase environment variables that are required to connect to a Firebase backend.

The Footer Component displays a random inspirational quote that is fetched using https://api.goprogram.ai/inspiration/docs/. The api updates the quote every hour, but the quote is only update if the page is refreshed or a new login occurs.

# Future Goals

Budget App is actively being built, and new features are being added almost daily! The next major feature will be a calendar page where income, savings, and scheduled expanses can be shown on a calendar.
